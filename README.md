# game-of-pig

General Rules:

This version of The Game of Pig accepts between 2-4 players. 
The goal for each player is to reach atleast 50 bank points.
Each player has a current sub score as well as a bank to store their points.

How to play:

1. A player can roll a die between 1 and 6. 
2. If this player gets any number other than 1, that number is added as points to the players current score.
3. This player can continue to roll and add points to his current total.
4. Or he may add his current points to his bank by hitting 'b' after his roll.
5. If a player rolls a 1 on their die, they lose all their points in their current total.
6. If a player rolls a 1, their turn is over, and the next players turn is active.
7. Players turns are sequential.
